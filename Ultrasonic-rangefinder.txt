
The ultrasonic distance measurement project involves using a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, an OLED display, a joystick, and the STM32 Nucleo L432KC development board. The sensor measures distance using ultrasonic waves, which are then displayed on the OLED screen. The joystick allows for easy navigation and manipulation of displayed data, including scrolling text and changing fonts. The STM32 Nucleo board processes the sensor data and controls the OLED display, enabling real-time distance measurement and display customization options.
